  One of the longest descents in Bali, Tukad Api (or Canyon of Fire, first image) is a must-do when in the Island of Gods. A total of 6-hrs of full committment inside the lush jungle with rappels up to 40m high, a guarantee of a special experience. Second image: the final narrows of Tukad Dalam, Kubutambahan, which has seen only one full descent.
