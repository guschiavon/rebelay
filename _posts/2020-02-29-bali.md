  The most established routes are in the Buleleng regency, namely in the
  surrounding areas of Gitgit and Sambangan villages. Remote descents like

  Some spectacular narrows in Tukad Dalam during the first descent in April
  2019. The remoteness of the Balinese canyons means you will find these places
  all for yourself during a descent. Despite, the wild environment requires
  local knowledge to be experienced safely.

  Volcanic basalt is the predominant rock type in Bali's canyons, providing
  incredible vertical descents and narrow gorges. The anchors are maintained by
  the local commercial operators and are generally found to be in good
  conditions year round.

  The wet season provides exciting water levels but some canyons might not be

  downpours which often result in flash floods. Here, Re:belay Editor Gus
