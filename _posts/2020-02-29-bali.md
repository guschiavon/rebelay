    alt_text: Some spectacular narrows in Tukad Dalam during the first descent in April 2019. The remoteness of the Balinese canyons means you will find these places all for yourself during a descent. Despite, the wild environment requires local knowledge to be experienced safely.

    title: Wet Season Thrills
